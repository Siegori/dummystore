    <p>As for a about me as a person, I'm someone who when given a task wishes to finish it
    and move on to the next task. Ideally I like to finish things sooner rather than later and
    am easily left bored if I do not constantly keep myself busy. I'd consider this
    a strength in the field of programming as you will rarely find my dawdling for no reason.
    Otherwise I'm a very laid back person despite my loud vocals</p>
    <p>I'm very passionate about game design, having intially learned a lot of Python by making simple games like connect 4 or minesweeper
    but being able to make anything interesting or useful is a hobby of mine. My dream job would be designing a digital card game but I lack
    capital to put proper work into it. Otherwise the local communities I participate in are important to me, which I will always try to make time for
    on weekends and wish to have the funds to assist in their growth.

    <h3>Education</h3>

    <p>I was put through Kenridge Primary School, up until I was sent to homeschool for my second level of eduation, where I finished my GED at 16
    and continued to do various online courses such as HyperionDev and ITAcademy. Unfortunately Covid hit at an inoppertune time so I spent ages 20 to 22
    stuck in the pandemic instead of progressing my career</p>

    <h3>Work Experience</h3>

    <p>I've done work with a small (now defunct) tech start-up called 'Nelware' as a trainee, where I was mentored
    to code in Python, My Mentor left a few months after I joined so I was left with no place in the company. I then did
    work in a cold storage facilitay that I have since then quit due to lack of work to do, as they simply asked me to "do nothing" for most of the day,
    which did no sit well with my desire to be busy, as they did not allow me to do anything else productive on company hours. I also briefly beta tested
    a Steam game I am not allowed to disclose at the current time</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Projects links</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, many of the projects I have worked on are not available for me to share through GitHub currently. I am allowed to share one of their
    contents I created an online application to manage to construct "tournament settings" for use in competitive sports. I did the backend for this task</p>
